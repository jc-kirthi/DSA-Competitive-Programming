## Easy
Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer k, find the position(0-based indexing) at which k is present in the array using binary search. If k doesn't exist in arr[] return -1.&nbsp;
Note: If multiple occurrences are there, please return the smallest index.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 4 appears at index 3.
Input: arr[] = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55], k = 445
Output: -1
Explanation: 445 is not present.
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 2], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: 1 appears at index 0.
Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1051 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1061 ≤ k ≤ 106
