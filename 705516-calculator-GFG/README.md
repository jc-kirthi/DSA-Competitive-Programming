Given two numbers&nbsp;a&nbsp;and&nbsp;b; you need to perform basic mathematical operation on them. You will be provided an integer named as&nbsp;operator.&nbsp;If operator equals to&nbsp;1&nbsp;add&nbsp;a&nbsp;and&nbsp;b, then print the result as a string.If operator equals to&nbsp;2&nbsp;subtract b from a, then&nbsp;print the result as a string.If operator equals to&nbsp;3&nbsp;multiply&nbsp;a&nbsp;and&nbsp;b,&nbsp;then&nbsp;print the result as a string.If operator equals to any another number, print "Invalid Input"(without quotes).Note: Do not add a new line at the end
Examples:
Input: a = 1, b = 2, opr = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 * 2 = 2
Input: a = 2, b = 2, opr = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: 2 - 2 = 0
Constraints:&nbsp;-100 ≤ a,b ≤ 100
