## Easy
Given an array arr[] containing the prices of items, your task is to calculate the average of all prices, rounded to two decimal places.Note:&nbsp; Return the average of all the items as a&nbsp;String.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 3.00 
Explanation: Sum of the array is 15, hence average is 15/5=3.00. 
Input: arr[] = [2, 55, 85, 656, 52, 554, 545, 5, 2]
Output: 217.33 
Explanation: Sum of the array is 1956, hence average is 1956/9= 217.33.&nbsp;
