## Easy
Given an integer choice denoting the choice of the user and a list&nbsp;containing the single value R or two values&nbsp;L and B depending on the choice.If the user's choice is 1, calculate the area of the circle having the given radius(R). &nbsp;Else if the choice is 2, calculate the area of the rectangle with the given length(L) and breadth(B).
Note : A list arr[], containing the single value R or the two values L and B, as input parameters. Return the area of the desired geometrical figure. Use Math.PI for the value of pi.
Examples :
Input: choice = 1, R = 5
Output: 78.53981633974483
Explaination: The choice is 1. So we have to calculate the area of the circle.
Input: choice = 2, L = 5, B = 10
Output: 50
Explaination: Here we have to calculate the area of the rectangle.
Expected Time Complexity: O(1)Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints:1 ≤ R, L, B ≤ 100&nbsp;
